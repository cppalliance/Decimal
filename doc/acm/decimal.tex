\section{Introduction}
Decimal floating-point arithmetic is crucial for many applications\cite{cowlishaw2003decimal}, particularly in financial and scientific computing. 
While several C++ decimal floating-point packages exist, they often lack IEEE 754\cite{ieee754-2019} conformance, interoperability with the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), or both, and have limited portability. 
This paper presents a novel decimal system that addresses these limitations and advances decimal floating-point technology. 
Our system is standalone, relies on a minimal subset of the C++ STL, and has been tested on a wide range of devices, from S390X mainframes to AVR boards. 
It provides seamless interoperability with existing C++ standard types and full IEEE 754 conformance, features not collectively offered by any known package. 
This work significantly enhances the toolset available for high-precision decimal computations across diverse computing environments.

\section{The Decimal System}

\subsection{Background}
Decimal floating point is a method of representing floating point numbers using base-10 instead of base-2 like most are familiar with.
Decimal floating point is not a new concept per se. 
Mechanical devices such as the abacus and slide rule use base-10 numbers.
Early computers such as the IBM 650 used decimal floating point numbers prior to IEEE standardization\cite{beebe2017historical}.
Some modern architectures support decimal floating point in hardware such as IBM System Z\cite{schwarz2009decimal}.
The advantage of decimal floating point is that it can represent human readable floating point numbers exactly unlike binary floating point.

The major difference between the layout of binary and decimal floating-point numbers lies in their internal structure and how they represent the same numerical value. Figure~\ref{fig:fp-layouts} illustrates this difference by showing the bit layout of the same number in both formats.

Binary floating-point numbers consist of three parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The sign bit (shown in blue)
    \item The exponent (shown in green)
    \item The significand (shown in red)
\end{itemize}

Decimal floating-point numbers, on the other hand, are composed of four distinct parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The sign bit (shown in blue)
    \item The combination field (shown in orange)
    \item The exponent continuation (shown in green)
    \item The coefficient continuation (shown in red)
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{layout.png}
    \caption{Bit layouts of Binary and Decimal Floating Point Numbers}
    \label{fig:fp-layouts}
\end{figure}

As depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:fp-layouts}, these different structures allow the same numerical value to be represented in two fundamentally different ways. 
The binary format uses a base-2 system, while the decimal format uses a base-10 system, which affects how precisely certain decimal values can be represented and how rounding errors propagate in calculations.
Due to these differences decimal can represent numbers exactly that binary cannot, for example the number 0.3 which with a C++ \code{double} would actually be: 0.30000000000000004.

\subsection{Provided Types}

The decimal system provides 6 total types: \code{decimal32}, \code{decimal64}, \code{decimal128}, \code{decimal32\_fast}, \code{decimal64\_fast}, and \code{decimal128\_fast}.
The first three types are conformant to IEEE-754 standards while the latter three provided identical numerical results without the constraints of IEEE-754.

The three conformant types is  the design specifications provided in IEEE-754 namely their properties:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{decimal32} & \textbf{decimal64} & \textbf{decimal128} \\
\hline
Storage Width & 32 & 64 & 128 \\
\hline
Precision (decimal digits) & 7 & 16 & 34 \\
\hline
Max Exponent & 96 & 384 & 6144 \\
\hline
Exponent Bias & 101 & 398 & 6176 \\
\hline
Sign Width & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline
Combination Field Width & 11 & 13 & 17 \\
\hline
Significand Continuation Width & 20 & 50 & 110 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Decimal Floating-Point Format Parameters}
\label{tab:decimal_params}
\end{table}

The three so-called fast types have the same values of precision, range, and exponent as their analogous conformant type, but require more space.

\subsection{System Architecture}

The decimal system architecture is robust and flexible.
Each type is implemented completely independently of each other, but they share many of the same function implementations from the STL.

\subsection{Using the System}

Every effort was made during design and implementation to ensure that using the decimal system was straightforward and intuitive.
The library contains zero dependencies, and uses only a small subsection of the C++ STL.
The required language standard for the library is C++14.


\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Basic Usage}, label={lst:basic_use}]
#include <boost/decimal.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

int main()
{
    using namespace boost::decimal;

    constexpr decimal32 val_1 {100};         // Construction from an integer
    constexpr decimal32 val_2 {10, 1};       // Construction from an integer and exponent
    constexpr decimal32 val_3 {1, 2, false}; // Construction from an integer, exponent, and sign

    std::cout << "Val_1: " << val_1 << '\n'
              << "Val_2: " << val_2 << '\n'
              << "Val_3: " << val_3 << '\n';

    if (val_1 == val_2 && val_2 == val_3 && val_1 == val_3)
    {
        std::cout << "All equal values" << std::endl;
    }

    constexpr decimal64 val_4 {decimal64{2, -1} + decimal64{1, -1}};
    constexpr double float_val_4 {0.2 + 0.1};
    const decimal64 val_5 { float_val_4 }; // Explicit Conversion from double

    std::cout << std::setprecision(17) << "Val_4: " << val_4 << '\n'
              <<  "Float: " << float_val_4 << '\n'
              <<  "Val_5: " << val_5 << '\n';

    if (val_4 == val_5)
    {
        std::cout << "Floats are equal" << std::endl;
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "Floats are not equal" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

In Listing~\ref{lst:basic_use} we show how to construct the type and that it works just like a built-in flowing point type. 
The following is an example that leverages one of decimal-floating points main strengths and one that we expect many people will use.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Basic Usage}, label={lst:charconv_use}]
#include <boost/decimal.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>

int main()
{
    using namespace boost::decimal;

    decimal64 val {0.25}; // Construction from a double (not recommended but explicit construction is allowed)

    char buffer[256];
    auto r_to = to_chars(buffer, buffer + sizeof(buffer) - 1, val);
    assert(r_to); // checks std::errc()
    *r_to.ptr = '\0';

    decimal64 return_value;
    auto r_from = from_chars(buffer, buffer + std::strlen(buffer), return_value);
    assert(r_from);

    assert(val == return_value);

    std::cout << " Initial Value: " << val << '\n'
              << "Returned Value: " << return_value << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

In Listing~\ref{lst:charconv_use} we show how to serialize and parse numbers.
These techniques and functions are an extension of Boost.Charconv\cite{charconv}.

\section{Implementation Details}

\subsection{IEEE 754 Conformant Decimal Types}

The decimal system provides three IEEE-754 compliant types: \code{decimal32}, \code{decimal64}, and \code{decimal128}.
Each of these are constructed using a single unsigned integer of the same width to hold the bits.
For example \code{decimal32} consists of a single \code{std::uint32\_t}.
\code{decimal128} uses a custom implementation of a 128-bit unsigned integer for portability reasons rather than relying on the existence of \code{unsigned \_\_int128}.
The discussion of implementing big integers is outside the scope of the paper, but papers and implementations can be found in numerous places\cite{charconv}\cite{lemire2021number}\cite{knuth}.

\subsection{IEEE 754 Fast Types}

Now that we have discussed the three IEEE-754 conformant types we will turn our attention to much more performant, but non-compliant types.
The library offers: \code{decimal32\_fast}, \code{decimal64\_fast}, and \code{decimal128\_fast}.

\subsection{Standard Library}

\subsubsection{Special Functions}

The implementation of transcendental, and C++17 special functions extensively uses Páde Approximations and Remez Polynomials.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Testing and Precision}
\subsection{Performance}

As this system is implemented in software it will never be as performant as binary floating point is on computing systems with floating-point hardware.
For example the table below shows the runtime difference for comparison operations between \code{float}, \code{double}, and the types provided by this system:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
\hline
Type & Runtime ($\mu$s) & Ratio to \texttt{double} \\
\hline
\texttt{float} & 8,587 & 1.376 \\
\texttt{double} & 6,240 & 1.000 \\
\texttt{decimal32} & 275,597 & 44.166 \\
\texttt{decimal64} & 296,929 & 47.587 \\
\texttt{decimal32\_fast} & 99,664 & 15.972 \\
\texttt{decimal64\_fast} & 102,132 & 16.367 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of runtime and ratio for comparison operations}
\label{tab:comp-comparison}
\end{table}

The gap in performance increases even further for the multiplication operation which is typically only a few cycles in hardware\cite{arm_trm}:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
\hline
Type & Runtime ($\mu$s) & Ratio to \texttt{double} \\
\hline
\texttt{float} & 1,646 & 0.957 \\
\texttt{double} & 1,720 & 1.000 \\
\texttt{decimal32} & 313,219 & 182.104 \\
\texttt{decimal64} & 583,818 & 339.429 \\
\texttt{decimal32\_fast} & 86,093 & 50.054 \\
\texttt{decimal64\_fast} & 333,582 & 193.943 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of runtime and ratio for multiplication operations}
\label{tab:mul-comparison}
\end{table}

For floating-point operations that are implemented in software like parsing and serializing numbers the performance gap is quite smaller:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
\hline
Type & Runtime ($\mu$s) & Ratio to \texttt{double} \\
\hline
\texttt{float} & 235,816 & 0.953 \\
\texttt{double} & 247,307 & 1.000 \\
\texttt{decimal32} & 366,682 & 1.483 \\
\texttt{decimal64} & 485,965 & 1.965 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of runtime and ratio for \code{from\_chars}}
\label{tab:from-chars-comparison}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
\hline
Type & Runtime ($\mu$s) & Ratio to \texttt{double} \\
\hline
\texttt{float} & 316,300 & 1.040 \\
\texttt{double} & 304,272 & 1.000 \\
\texttt{decimal32} & 406,053 & 1.335 \\
\texttt{decimal64} & 678,451 & 2.230 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of runtime and ratio for \code{to\_chars}}
\label{tab:runtime-comparison}
\end{table}

\section{Conclusion and Outlook}

The portable C++ decimal system has been presented.
The system allows for users to easily employ decimal-floating point numbers in their existing code bases.
For the first time a complete and interoperable system has been fully provided.

During the course of our research and implementation we have limited ourselves to 32, 64, and 128-bit types.
Further research can be conducted into making higher precision types as the properties of such numbers are specified in IEEE 754.
We could also expand our range of compatibility to allow the types to be massively parallelized such as providing support for CUDA devices.

Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting
margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
and the use of the \verb|\vspace| command to manually adjust the
vertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not allowed.

{\bfseries Your document will be returned to you for revision if
  modifications are discovered.}

\section{Typefaces}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the
``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \TeX\ installation should include
this set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The
``\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\verb|ltimes|'' packages should not be used,
as they will override the built-in typeface families.

\section{Title Information}

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
\url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
{\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.

If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used
in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title|
command has a ``short title'' parameter:
\begin{verbatim}
  \title[short title]{full title}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Authors and Affiliations}

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
identification.  As an exception, multiple authors may share one
affiliation. Authors' names should not be abbreviated; use full first
names wherever possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever
possible.

Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail
alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:
\begin{verbatim}
  \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
  \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
  \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note
to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors
of an article contributed equally to the work.

If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of
the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
overlapping text. The following command should be placed just after
the last \verb|\author{}| definition:
\begin{verbatim}
  \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
\end{verbatim}
Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all
of the authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the
page headers.

The article template's documentation, available at
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}, has a
complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective
use.

Note that authors' addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

\section{Rights Information}

Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a rights
form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice
made by the author, this may be copyright transfer, permission,
license, or an OA (open access) agreement.

Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will receive a
copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This
form contains \LaTeX\ commands that must be copied into the source
document. When the document source is compiled, these commands and
their parameters add formatted text to several areas of the final
document:
\begin{itemize}
\item the ``ACM Reference Format'' text on the first page.
\item the ``rights management'' text on the first page.
\item the conference information in the page header(s).
\end{itemize}

Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing several
works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of commands with
each of the works.

The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over one
page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

\section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
search.

The ACM Computing Classification System ---
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
the research being presented.

CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
two-page articles (or abstracts).

\section{Sectioning Commands}

Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands:
\verb|section|, \verb|subsection|, \verb|subsubsection|, and
\verb|paragraph|. They should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
from the commands.

Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\bfseries not allowed.}

\section{Tables}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
high-quality tables.

Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
\textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.

\begin{table*}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and
use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
more easily.

\section{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
which can be invoked with the usual
\texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\section{Figures}

The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
in the example below.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
  \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
    Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
    Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
  \Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
\end{figure}

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
the reader.

Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely
decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image to someone
who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine crawlers for
indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.

A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than 2000
characters long (including spaces).  {\bfseries Figure descriptions
  should not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture
  important information that is not already provided in the caption or
  the main text of the paper.} For figures that convey important and
complex new information, a short text description may not be
adequate. More complex alternative descriptions can be placed in an
appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example,
provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a
structured list representing a graph.  For additional information
regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is
so important, please see
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}.

\subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before
the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
\verb|\maketitle| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{teaserfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
    \caption{figure caption}
    \Description{figure description}
  \end{teaserfigure}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Citations and Bibliographies}

The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
(``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
article DOI, etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
  \bibliography{decimal_bib}
\end{verbatim}
where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before the command
``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
\begin{verbatim}
  \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
\end{verbatim}


  Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
  enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
  issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
  monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
  \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
  \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
  the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
  Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
  a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a
  divisible book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as
  book \cite{Knuth97}, a couple of articles in a proceedings (of a
  conference, symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings
  article) \cite{Andler79, Hagerup1993}, a proceedings article with
  all possible elements \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated
  proceedings article \cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work
  \cite{Harel78}, a couple of preprints \cite{Bornmann2019,
    AnzarootPBM14}, a doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a
  master's thesis: \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web
  resource \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game
  (Case 1) \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05}
  and (Case 3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for
  publication \cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author
  \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might
  contain 'duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles)
  \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Boris / Barbara Beeton:
  multi-volume works as books \cite{MR781536} and \cite{MR781537}. A
  couple of citations with DOIs:

\section{Acknowledgments}

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{acks}
  ...
  \end{acks}
\end{verbatim}
so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

\section{Appendices}

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
document.

Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \appendix
\end{verbatim}
and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
and subsection identification method.

\section{Multi-language papers}

Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as a
rule, a paper in a language other than English should include an
English title and an English abstract).  Use \verb|language=...| for
every language used in the paper.  The last language indicated is the
main language of the paper.  For example, a French paper with
additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start with
the following command
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
               language=french]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the main
language of the paper.  The commands \verb|\translatedXXX|, \verb|XXX|
begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
in the other languages.  The environment \verb|translatedabstract| is
used to set the translation of the abstract.  These commands and
environment have a mandatory first argument: the language of the
second argument.  See \verb|sample-sigconf-i13n.tex| file for examples
of their usage.

\section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
the margin:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{sidebar}:]  Place formatted text in the margin.
\item[\texttt{marginfigure}:] Place a figure in the margin.
\item[\texttt{margintable}:] Place a table in the margin.
\end{description}
