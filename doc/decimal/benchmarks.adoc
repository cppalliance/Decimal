[#Benchmarks]
= Benchmarks
:idprefix: benchmarks_

This section describes a range of performance benchmarks that have been run comparing this library with the standard library, and how to run your own benchmarks if required.

The values in the ratio column are how many times longer running a specific operation takes in comparison to the same operation with a `double`.

IMPORTANT: On nearly all platforms there is hardware support for binary floating point math, so we are comparing hardware to software runtimes; *Decimal will be slower*

== How to run the Benchmarks
[#run_benchmarks_]

To run the benchmarks yourself, navigate to the test folder and define `BOOST_DECIMAL_RUN_BENCHMARKS` when running the tests.
An example on Linux with b2: `../../../b2 cxxstd=20 toolset=gcc-13 define=BOOST_DECIMAL_RUN_BENCHMARKS benchmarks -a release` .

== Comparisons

The benchmark for comparisons generates a random vector containing 2,000,000 elements and does operations `>`, `>=`, `<`, `\<=`, `==`, and `!=` between `vec[i] and vec[i + 1]`.
This is repeated 5 times to generate stable results.

== Basic Operations

The benchmark for these operations generates a random vector containing 2,000,000 elements and does operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` between `vec[i] and vec[i + 1]`.
This is repeated 5 times to generate stable results.

== Selected Special Functions

The benchmark for these operations generates a random vector containing 2,000,000 elements and does operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` between `vec[i] and vec[i + 1]`.
This is repeated 5 times to generate stable results.

NOTE: `decimal128` is currently absent due to results showing it is 2 orders of magnitude faster than the others.
This should not be the case so will be investigated.
