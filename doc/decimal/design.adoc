== C++14 Requirement

=== Constexpr Support

Using C++14's relaxed definition of `constexpr` nearly all functionality of the library can be constexpr.
This allows Boost.Decimal to better emulate the functionality a built-in type would have.

=== Boost.Math Integration

Boost.Math requires C++14 as the minimum language standard for the library.
By meeting this requirement, and Boost.Math's conceptual requirements for a user-defined type we are able to provide the statistics, interpolation, quadrature, etc. out of the box.
