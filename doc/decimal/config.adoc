= Configuration Macros
:idprefix: config_

The following configuration macros are available:

- `BOOST_DECIMAL_STANDALONE`: Allows the library to be used without any boost dependencies.
If `<boost/config.hpp>` (the only depedency) is not present on your system it is automatically defined

- `BOOST_DECIMAL_DISABLE_CASSERT`: Disables the use of `<cassert>` and all run-time assertions.

- `BOOST_DECIMAL_DISABLE_IOSTREAM`: Disables the use of I/O streaming and removes all associated headers (e.g. `<iostream>`, `<iosfwd>`, `<cwchar>`, etc.)

- `BOOST_DECIMAL_DISABLE_CLIB`: Defines both of the above macros. In testing this reduces ROM usage by ~50%.
